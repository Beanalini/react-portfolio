  ### Functional Requirements

  The functional requirements that React Portfolio has been designed to meet are defined by the user story and acceptance criteria listed below.  

  #### User Story

AS AN employer looking for candidates with experience building single-page applications
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed React portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
